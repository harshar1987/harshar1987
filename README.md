<p>Hi, I'm <b>Harsha R</b>, a passionate full-stack developer from Bangalore, India. I have over <b>12 years of experience</b> in building B2B SaaS products using <b> .NET & JavaScript stack. </b>  

I care about writing clean, readable & understandable code. I practice the Boy Scout rule & opportunistic refactoring and follow the <b>YAGNI, KISS , DRY principles</b>. 

Apart from work, I like to spend time with my family and play with my 2-year-old. I also like to read technical books and utilize my free time to read Software Engineering books, tech blogs, articles, or videos.
